## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
-HTML
-CSS

### What I learned

I really focused hard on making sure I was successfully using flexbox for the layout, and trying to stay consistent with using rems, though I haven't quite gotten that down yet. Overall I think I did well. 


### Continued development

I will continue to work with flexbox until I have it mastered. 

I need more work with media queries. 

I also struggled trying to get to images to overlap and have transparency upon hover. I will be reaching out to see if I can fix this. 

### Useful resources

MDN and google.
